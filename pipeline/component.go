// The MiddlewareComponent interface describes the functionality required by a middleware component.
// The Init method is used to perform any one-off setup,
// and the other method, named ProcessRequest, is responsible for processing HTTP requests.
// The parameters defined by the ProcessRequest method are a pointer to a ComponentContext struct
// and a function that passes the request to the next component in the pipeline.
// Everything a component needs to process a request is provided by the ComponentContext struct,
// through which http.Request and http.ResponseWriter can be accessed.
// The ComponentContext struct also defines an unexported error field, which is used to indicate a problem processing a request
// and which is set using the Error method.

// By implementing a method named ImplementsProcessRequestWithServices, components can indicate they require services.
// It isnâ€™t possible to include the method that requires the services in the interface
// because each component needs a different method signature for the services it requires.
// Instead, I am going to detect the ServicesMiddlwareComponent and then use reflection
// to determine whether the component implements a method named ProcessRequestWithServices,
// whose first two parameters are the same as the ProcessRequest method defined by the MiddlewareComponent interface.
// To pipeline.go added the new feature to the function that creates the pipeline and also populates the component struct fields
// with services when the pipeline is prepared.
